/*
	A Halfedge_Mesh is a data structure that makes it easy to iterate over (and
	modify) a polygonal mesh.  The basic idea is that each edge of the mesh
	gets associated with two "halfedges," one on either side, that point in
	opposite directions.  These halfedges essentially serve as the "glue"
	between different mesh elements (vertices, edges, and faces).  A half edge
	mesh has the same basic flavor as a tree or linked list data structure:
	each node has pointers that reference other nodes.  In particular, each
	half edge points to:

	   -its root vertex,
	   -its associated edge,
	   -the face it sits on,
	   -its "twin", i.e., the halfedge on the other side of the edge,
	   -and the next halfedge in cyclic order around the face.

	Vertices, edges, and faces each point to just one of their incident
	halfedges.  For instance, an edge will point arbitrarily to either
	its "left" or "right" halfedge.  Each vertex will point to one of
	many halfedges leaving that vertex.  Each face will point to one of
	many halfedges going around that face.  The fact that these choices
	are arbitrary does not at all affect the practical use of this data
	structure: they merely provide a starting point for iterating over
	the local region (e.g., walking around a face, or visiting the
	neighbors of a vertex).  A practical example of iterating around a
	face might look like:

	   HalfEdgeIter h = myFace->halfedge();
	   do
	   {
		  // do something interesting with h
		  h = h->next();
	   }
	   while( h != myFace->halfEdge() );

	At each iteration we walk to the "next" halfedge, until we return
	to the original starting point.  A slightly more interesting
	example is iterating around a vertex:

	   HalfEdgeIter h = myVertex->halfedge();
	   do
	   {
		  // do something interesting with h
		  h = h->twin()->next();
	   }
	   while( h != myVertex->halfedge() );

	(Can you draw a picture that explains this iteration?)  A very
	different kind of iteration is when we want to iterate over, say,
   all* the edges of a mesh:

	   for( EdgeIter e = mesh.edges.begin(); e != mesh.edges.end(); e++ )
	   {
		  // do something interesting with e
	   }

	A very important consequence of the halfedge representation is that
	---by design---it can only represent manifold, orientable triangle
	meshes.  I.e., every point should have a neighborhood that looks disk-
	like, and you should be able to assign to each polygon a normal
	direction such that all these normals "point the same way" as you walk
	around the surface.

	At a high level, that's all there is to know about the half edge
	data structure.  But it's worth making a few comments about how this
	particular implementation works---especially how things like boundaries
	are handled.  First and foremost, the "pointers" used in this
	implementation are actually STL iterators.  STL stands for the "standard
	template library," and is a basic part of C++ that provides some very
	convenient and powerful data structures and algorithms---if you've never
	looked at STL before, now would be a great time to get familiar!  At
	a high level, STL iterators behave a lot like pointers: they don't store
	data, but rather reference some data that is allocated elsewhere.  And
	the syntax is also very similar; for instance, if p is an iterator, then
	*p yields the value referred to by p.  (As for the rest, Google is a
	terrific resource! :-))

	Rather than accessing raw iterators, the Halfedge_Mesh encapsulates these
	pointers using methods like Halfedge::twin(), Halfedge::next(), etc.  The
	reason for this encapsulation (as in most object-oriented programming)
	is that it allows the user to make changes to the internal representation
	later down the line.  For instance, if you know that the connectivity of
	the mesh is never going to change, you might be able to improve performance
	by (internally) replacing the linked lists with fixed-length arrays,
	without breaking any code that might have been written using the abstract
	interface.  (There are deeper reasons for this kind of encapsulation
	when working with polygon meshes, but that's a story for another time!)

	Finally, some surfaces have "boundary loops," e.g., a pair of pants has
	three boundaries: one at the waist, and two at the ankles.  These boundaries
	are represented by special faces in our halfedge mesh---in fact, rather than
	being stored in the usual list of faces (Halfedge_Mesh::faces), they are
	stored in a separae list of boundary loops (Halfedge_Mesh::boundaries).  Each
	face (boundary or regular) also stored a flag Face::_isBoundary that
	indicates whether or not it is a boundary.  This value can be queried via the
	public method Face::isBoundary() (again: encapsulation!)  So for instance, if
	I wanted to know the area of all polygons that touch a given vertex, I might
	write some code like this:

	   double totalArea = 0.;
	   HalfEdgeIter h = myVertex->halfedge();
	   do
	   {
		  // don't add the area of boundary faces!
		  if( !h->face()->isBoundary() )
		  {
			 totalArea != h->face()->area();
		  }
		  h = h->twin()->next();
	   }
	   while( h != myVertex->halfedge() );

	In other words, whenever I'm processing a face, I should stop and ask: is
	this really a geometric face in my mesh?  Or is it just a "virtual" face
	that represents a boundary loop?  Finally, for convenience, the halfedge
	associated with a boundary vertex is the first halfedge on the boundary.
	In other words, if we want to iterate over, say, all faces touching a
	boundary vertex, we could write

	   HalfEdgeIter h = myBoundaryVertex->halfedge();
	   do
	   {
		  // do something interesting with h
		  h = h->twin()->next();
	   }
	   while( !h->isBoundary() );

	(Notice that this loop will never terminate for an interior vertex!)

	More documentation can be found in the inline comments below.
