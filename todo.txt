Exporting meshes from blender:
	Main: Global Oreintation: -Z Forward, Y Up, Apply Global Oreintation
	Geom: NO Triangulate
	View: Smooth Shaded

TODO:
	General:
		swap to cmake build system
		better per-frame mesh update performance
		better mesh undo memory usage
		document app/gui/scene code

	UX Features:
		changing the origin of a mesh
		scene graph (parenting, etc)
		mesh rest pose preview in GUI sidebar


	[ RASTERIZER ]

	Designing replacement for DrawSVG
		- transforms, depth & projection
		- triangle rasterizer
		- real-time rendering pipeline
		- basic shader?


	[ MESHEDIT ]

	fix bevel compute positions dragging at edge of window
	split scene & modeling GUI data - no bevel op in scene view
	move mesh update & select code out of Renderer

	stub meshedit global ops

	second camera for mesh editing
		zoom to selected element


	[ PATHTRACER ]

	Mode: render (+mesh shading options)
	Port and simplify code
		I'd like to refactor it more like https://github.com/TheNumbat/dawn


	[ ANIMATION ]

	Mode: rig
	Mode: animate
	Mode: simulate
	Port and simplify code
